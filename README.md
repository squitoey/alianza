Alianza programming problem for job application.

To make things happen, simply run "./gradlew test" from the root project directory. This will compile everything and run the tests.

The test results will be in the build/reports/tests/index.html

In order to run the application run "./gradlew runApp" this will download all dependencies (gradle, testng), compile the
application and then run it. Output is AlianzaHistogram.txt and AlianzaAscending.txt

Standard "gradle idea" and "gradle eclipse" can be used to generate IDE project files.
